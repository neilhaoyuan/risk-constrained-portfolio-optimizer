    "Secondary Optimization logic: Let n be the size of the tickers, we now have an optimized weighting for those n stocks\n",
    "We want to find the most optimal set up of 10-25 stocks out of those n. To do so we will try every combination, however if we wanted to brute force from those n stocks it'd take an absurd amount of compute. Instead we will take into the fact that we have the weightings of the (unconstrained) optimization. The higher the weighting of an asset, the more important it is to the minimizing the  variance, thus we will sort the n-optimized assets from highest to lowest weighting. Starting from the top we will then build a 10-25 asset size portfolio and calculate the variance of each portfolio, finding the one with the least variance. \n",

    "In regards to the max amount of sectors, when building the portfolios we will keep count of the sectors, if any sector exceeds a certain amount such that are over represented, we skip an asset and move on\n",
